# yieldz
a calculator utility for expected agricultural yields given known crops and known inputs

This calculator lets you get some metrics on your hemp/cannabis (or other) harvest. it is designed for all users, but particular focus is paid towards METRC compliance (for licensed facilities) and medical home-growers. 

The idea is to give the user/grower tools to make educated decisions about yields when growing for processing, i.e. hash, tincture, and other medicine where the traditional g/W equation breaks down.

A goal of the project is to keep all files in control of the user, allowing a self-admined SAAS / cloud app with local control over individual data.
