fills a dict w/ the info the thing needs

per run things: 
veg time
flower time
strain
watts
harvest weight
trim weight wet
trim weight dry
waste weight 
a buds
b buds
c buds

hash: input
- 1st pull
- 2nd pull 
- b grade
- food grade
- total 

rosin: input
- 1st press
- 90-120 
- b grade
- full spec 
- food grade
- total

per plant things:
tag#
harvest weight


so this is what the below will need to do. I think I need to do it in steps. 
like, poll @ harvest, @ trim, @ hash 
csv-compatible is the goal
