"""
this program calculates and stores expected yields of various processes 
(harvest weight, trim weight, dry weight, hash, rosin)
including various grades etc
versus inputs (watts, nutrients, etc)
to generate expected yields for a known clone in a known space 

storage of past runs, predictions, etc via local text file and nothing else. no clouds.

per run things: 
veg time
flower time
strain

harvest weight
trim weight wet
trim weight dry
waste weight 
prewash
a buds
b buds
c buds

hash: input
- 1st pull
- 2nd pull 
- b grade
- food grade
- total 

rosin: input
- 1st press
- 90-120

- food grade
- total

per plant things:

harvest weight


so this is what the below will need to do. I think I need to do it in steps. 
like, poll @ harvest, @ trim, @ hash 
csv-compatible is the goal

options: 
- generate run, will poll parameters and record, display results, can supply filename
- recall run, will display results of target
- compare runs, will sort multiple runs given restrictions 
- clone success rates??? idk 

- so thats a mode and a target 
- optional filename, required filename, folder? or wildcard or maybe matching name search - would be cool
